        <p>Welcome to our story, where the Sun meets the Moon. Together, we illuminate each other’s lives, revealing the beauty that lies within.</p>

            <h2>The Sun (Me)</h2>
            <p>The Sun shines brightly, strong and steadfast. It has its own light, but it's not known for its beauty. It exists to bring light to others.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="moon">
            <img src="moon.png" alt="Moon" class="icon">
            <h2>The Moon (You)</h2>
            <p>The Moon is a symbol of beauty, mysterious and serene. But without the Sun, it cannot shine on its own.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="together">
        <h2>Together We Shine</h2>
        <p>The Sun, with its powerful light, illuminates the Moon, revealing its true beauty. And the Moon, in turn, gives the Sun a purpose, showing the world the beauty it can reveal. Without the Moon, the Sun’s light would have no beauty to reveal; without the Sun, the Moon’s beauty would remain hidden.</p>

    <section class="our-story">
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>In the same way, you bring out the best in me, and I help you shine in your own unique way. Together, we are complete.</p>

    <section class="special-message">
        <h2>A Special Message</h2>
        <p>You are the Moon to my Sun, and together, we create something beautiful. Without you, my world would be bright, but not beautiful. With you, we can make the world shine.</p>

        <p>I hope this website shows you how much you mean to me. Together, we can light up the world.</p>
